A lot of videos to watch...

Egor Malkevich is a real guru of Node in the modern web development business.

I have watched a few of his YouTube videos this week already.

One more looks very interesting: [#20 Что такое Express js и почему все хайпуют от Nest.js ... | Minsk JSON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ83ruPYESU&t=94s)

Stopped watching it at 40:58 since I need a pause. Will continue later.

Another video that I want to watch is [Адаптивная HTML-верстка макета из Figma с подробным объяснением. Советы от профи. HTML SCSS GULP.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkq7ckCkvjY) by Женя Андриканич (I don't know how he transliterates his name).

Zhenya uses Gulp for building websites. There is a lot of configurations to prepare for the flow to be smooth.
