Today I started playing with Dendron.

It is quite buggy, but with some effort, I was able to get it work.

It has a Calendar View feature, which is quite close to what Zhurnik could be.

Dendron has some learning friction.
It is not easy to get started, and the overall organization poses questions.

Mostly, I don't like the flat file structure.
Relying on the tree view is insufficient, to my mind.
